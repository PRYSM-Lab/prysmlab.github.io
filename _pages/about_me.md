# Vassilis Charitopoulos, FHEA, PhD, MEng

Dr Vassilis Charitopoulos (he/him) is a Lecturer (Assistant Professor) in the Department of Chemical Engineering at UCL and the Principal Investigator of the PRYSM Lab. He specialises in developing optimization models and methods to incorporate uncertainty for chemical process and energy systems problems. He holds a Diploma in Chemical Engineering from the National Technical University of Athens and a PhD from the Department of Chemical Engineering at UCL.

Before joining UCL, he was a Research Associate at the Energy Policy Research Group at Cambridge Judge Business School where he worked on optimisation of heat decarbonisation pathways. Dr. Charitopoulos has received global recognition for his excellent research activity including: Springer Thesis Award (2019), UCL David Newton Prize (2019). He was the recipient of an Early Career Fellowship (2019) from the Isaac Newton Trust, University of Cambridge. In 2022, he was Highly Commended as Best Young Researcher by the IChemE Global Awards.

His current research focuses on the development of novel techniques for model-based and data-driven optimisation frameworks for digital process manufacturing and sustainable energy systems engineering.
