<span style="font-size: 20px;">Welcome to the **PR**ocess & energ**Y** **S**ystems opti**M**ization (**PRYSM**) Lab at [UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/chemical-engineering). Our research focuses on computational optimization under uncertainty & digital methods for challenging problems spanning from net zero energy & chemicals to digital supply chain operations. </span>

<span style="font-size: 20px;">Led by [Dr Vassilis Charitopoulos](/al-folio/people/) the lab is within the Department of Chemical Engineering at UCL and affiliated with the [Sargent Centre for Process Systems Engineering](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/process-systems-engineering/) at Imperial College London.

<span style="font-size: 20px;">**Why optimization under uncertainty?** Uncertainty is ubiquitous in decision-making problems across the engineering discipline. 90% of infrastructure projects with value over £1 billion go over budget or over deadline due to improper uncertainty management. Novartis shut down a plant in 2021 due to overestimation in gene therapy demand, while the eminent defossilisation of the chemical industry only underscores the need for systematic treatment of uncertainty. At PRYSM we develop next-generation methods for systematically hedging against uncertainty, with recent application areas including: (i) **net-zero energy supply chain planning**, (ii) **digital twins in pharma**, (iii) **sustainable process design & control**.
